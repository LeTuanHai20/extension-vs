## Code Help and Completion

Take advantage of type based, blazing fast code completion, signature help and colorful tooltips within VS Code. The editor is context aware, lists available symbols with detailed information, performs type analysis and completes selected options. It also autocompletes dollar character for variables and even provides a link to online documentation when possible.

The integrated manual of all PHP symbols is localized for major languages - English, Japanese, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Russian, or Chinese.

## Debug

Run the integrated built-in server or connect to a remote server. Debug is provided through Xdebug extension and provides you with all you need. See and manage breakpoints, watch expressions, locals or the call stack or change the variables value. Tooltips reveal the expression's value as well.

## Continuous Code Validation

Reveal troublesome issues and problems without testing, and even before running the code. The built-in type analysis and code validation will check the entire project in seconds, and it gets updated as you type. Problems are listed in the `Problems` window and underlined right in the code editor.

## Navigation

The editor provides you with `Go to definition`, `Find all references` and browsing through all the symbols within the current document and the workspace. It takes advantage of the type analysis and context aware search, quickly navigating even through extremely large projects.

## Rename Refactoring

Safely find and rename variables, classes, interfaces or functions with a single press of a key. The feature takes into account PHPDoc comments, possible indirect variables or dynamic code constructs.

## Code Formatting

The code formatter makes the code look clean and unified. It understands your conventions, keeps your multiline expressions as you wrote them, adjusts the comment blocks, pretty prints the expressions and nicely purifies the rest. Code is formatted automatically when you finish the statement or a code block.

## Testing

PHPUnit tests within the project are detected and automatically listed in new Test Explorer panel. You can run and debug all the tests or just one. All the listed tests are marked with the succeeded icon with details of the test run. Optionally you can even enable continuous testing.
